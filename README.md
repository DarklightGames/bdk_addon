The Blender addon for the BDK (Blender Development Kit) project.

The BDK allows users to use a custom build of Blender as a game level authoring tool for games derived from the Unreal 2 engine.

This project is currently in active development towards a first beta release. If you want to partake in the beta, contact `colin.basnett` on Discord.

# Features
* Powerful procedural terrain sculpting and painting functionality.
* Unreal Materials recreated with Blender's material node system (e.g., `Combiners`, `TexOscillators` etc.)
* Create, texture, and build level geometry with BSP brushes directly in Blender.
* All game/mod assets exported to easy-to-use asset libraries, allowing for drag & drop placement of static meshes.
* Copy & paste Unreal objects (static meshes, terrain etc.) between the Blender (BDK) and the Unreal 2 SDK using T3D serialization.
* Even more to come!
